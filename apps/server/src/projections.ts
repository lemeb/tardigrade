// projection of the log). Nothing in this module touches a store, a host, or a clock, so a route is
// a lookup plus one of these calls, and a test is an array of events.
//
// The projections read the framework's own projections wherever one already answers the question:
// the thread's owed work comes from the code thread (@clavia/tardigrade-code/execution/projections), and a turn's
// outcome comes from the thread's boundary (tardie/boundary). The vocabulary the wire
// speaks is the only thing added here.

// ThreadStatus is the summary vocabulary of GET /v1/threads. Four answers, in the order they are
// decided: a thread whose work cannot move is blocked, a thread that owes a transition is running,
// a thread whose last turn died owing nothing is failed, and anything else has settled.

// means an open `BlockedOn` whose awaited reply has not landed; the moment it lands the same head
// can progress and reads running again (projections.test.ts, "a landed reply unblocks the thread").
