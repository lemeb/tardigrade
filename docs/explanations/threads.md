# Actors, threads, and placement

An actor is a behavior definition. A thread is one durable run of that actor. Every thread owns one event log, one workspace, and one recovery lifecycle.

## Storage boundaries

`ThreadEventStore` is the storage contract for one thread. Its operations do not accept a thread identifier because the store already has that identity. Host ingress, host reads, and reactors use the same store object, so append policy and read behavior cannot diverge between paths.

`readKey` answers the one event a durable key names, and `readSubject` the latest event a subject names. A key names one occurrence; a subject names one fact, and a later event under the same subject supersedes the earlier one. Each answer comes from an index beside the log, in time proportional to the answer, so a read that refreshes a receipt pays for its facts instead of the session. The subject index is a separate table: the key index is an append-time deduplication structure with at most one row per key, so it cannot hold a superseding occurrence, and the message events a receipt needs are deliberately unkeyed. A store initialized over a log that predates the table captures the missing subjects before its first indexed read, so an existing thread answers exactly like one created after the table.

An actor instance is a durable supervisor. Its event log records `ThreadRequested` and `ThreadCreated`, and its thread tree is a projection of those events. Event data remains in each thread's store.

## Durable Object layout

An actor definition gives the actor its name, methods, reactors, and model catalog. Each actor instance gets an Actor DO that runs the actor supervisor and owns its identity and thread tree. Root and child Thread DOs are physical peers. A parent-child edge records logical ancestry and does not nest one Durable Object inside another.

## Child placement

A spawn may request `placement: "colocated" | "independent"`. The host uses `defaultChildPlacement` when the request omits it.

`colocated` means the child has its own execution stream and durable state within the parent host's placement boundary. On Bun, colocated threads use separate SQLite databases and runtimes in the same process. A Cloudflare Facets adapter can map colocated children to facets under one supervisor Durable Object.

`independent` means the host places the child's execution stream independently from the parent. Independent placement does not guarantee a different process or machine. The standard Cloudflare Durable Object adapter supports independent placement. A Bun host supports colocated placement. Each adapter exports its supported placements and default, and rejects an unsupported request.

## Platform layout

The Bun actor database is a directory and routing index. Thread databases live beside it under `<actor>.sqlite.threads/`. Each thread database contains that thread's event log and workspace. The model-facing workspace SQL surface remains separate from the event log. Effect SQL records migrations in `effect_sql_migrations` inside each physical database.

Cloudflare uses one Actor DO for the actor supervisor and one Thread DO per thread. Each Thread DO has its own SQLite database, heap, driver, and alarm lifecycle. The Actor DO builds the actor-wide thread tree from its lifecycle log without reading any thread event log. Each tree node contains its id, parent, depth, placement, and children. Effect SQL applies each DO's schema migrations before the DO records its identity or opens its event store.

Root creation passes through the Actor DO once. For a child, the Thread DO first stages `ThreadCreated` and the initial message without running them. The Actor DO then records `ThreadRequested`. Its reactor gives recovery ownership to the Thread DO and records `ThreadCreated`, which adds the child to the actor tree. The Actor DO alarm retries an unfinished request. Later appends and deliveries address the created Thread DO directly.

## Encrypted event stores

`storeFor` sets the event store policy for each Cloudflare thread. Its `codec` can encrypt a plaintext object containing the event and a binding to the thread and event identity. The store derives the logical event key before encoding the body. Its `indexKey` function can replace that key with a deterministic HMAC before SQLite uses the key for equality and uniqueness. Decryption verifies that the encrypted binding matches the current thread and the clear identity inside the sealed event before returning the event.

`hmacSha256EventKeyIndex` binds the HMAC input to the thread and returns a versioned hexadecimal index. The application supplies HMAC key material separate from its AES-GCM key. This prevents the SQLite index from exposing sensitive grant tokens, call IDs, and other event key identifiers. The subject index passes its coordinates through the same `indexKey` transform, so a sealed deployment answers exact-fact reads by sealing the query the same way while the table holds no readable coordinates.

workerd does not support importing an HKDF key through `SubtleCrypto`, so the application must provision raw keys or use an external key service. workerd also ignores AES-GCM `additionalData`. The binding therefore lives inside the encrypted plaintext and is checked after decryption. A random 96-bit initialization vector is generated for every encrypted event.
