// unanswered awaiting call is an edge to the thread whose settle answers
// it. A cycle is a deadlock: every member thread rests honestly, blocked
// on the world, and the world is the other members. No thread-local
// invariant can see a cycle (packages/core/tla/interaction/Delivery.tla, the
// DeliveryDeadlock config is the pinned trace); only the tier that
// sees all threads can break one.

// effect/Graph (experimental) stays inside this file. No Graph type
// crosses the exported surface, so the engine can change without any
// consumer noticing.
