// codeReactorFor derives the executable head as one transition: the settle is the record
// (`cs:<identity>` through codeKeys), one attempt is the act. `workOwed` is the readiness gate:
// a blocked head (open BlockedOn calls, no awaited reply home) derives nothing, so the thread
// rests honestly and a landing reply re-derives it. An attempt that parks mid-act returns
// BlockedOn evidence instead of the settle; the reconciler reads that as blocked, never wedged.
//
// The packages arrive as values, and what they need arrives with them: the reactor's environment
// is the spill store plus the union of the packages' own requirements, so a thread assembled with a
// service-needing package cannot be run where that service is missing (execute.test.ts, "a
// package's requirements ride its type"). Which packages are passed is the component scope: the
// code can only name these, and the empty array is the powerless thread (packages.ts, Package).
// Two packages under one name would make `pkg.name` ambiguous in the body's scope, so a duplicate
// is a construction-time error, the same reading the infer root takes of two components claiming
// one tool name (packages/agent/src/runtime/composition.ts, infer).
