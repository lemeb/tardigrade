// tla/projection/Projection.tla); order survives only as data an event carries. The alphabet these read
// is six events: CodeDispatched, PackageCalled, PackageReturned, BlockedOn, MessageReceived,
// CodeSettled. "Running" is runtime-local to the driver, never derived from the log. "Parked"
// is never a state, only evidence: a `BlockedOn { callId, awaiting }` says one attempt observed
// one response absent, and the derivation reads it as membership arithmetic (is the awaited id in
// the set now?). The parking call records what it awaits, so no method table exists here.
