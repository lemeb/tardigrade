/**
 * intent constructs a typed event proposal and erases its input type for heterogeneous transition collections.
 *
 * Input is inferred while the proposal is authored, so events receives the same type as input:
 *
 *   intent({
 *     input: MyInput,
 *     events: (input: MyInput, at) => Event[]
 *   })
 *
 * Different intents carry different input types. Intent<never> hides that private type so they can share one collection:
 *
 *   Intent<InputA> ─┐
 *   Intent<InputB> ─┼─> ReadonlyArray<Intent<never>>
 *   Intent<InputC> ─┘
 *
 * The constructor keeps each input value paired with the events function that consumes it. The runtime must pass the stored input back to that same function.
